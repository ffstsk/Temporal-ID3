# TemporalID3
ID3 with HS multi-modal interval temporal logic


Extract the data from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Australian+Sign+Language+signs+%28High+Quality%29. 
After the extraction, create a new directory in the same working directory named 'data', that is, you will have two files in the same directory: 1) 'preprocessing.py' and 2) 'data/'.

Run the code (changing parameters 'alpha' and 'beta').
